    <p>The historical places in Bangalore list definitely needs to start with the Bangalore Palace. Famous for its rich history, the palace draws inspiration from the Windsor Castle that is located in England. The Bangalore palace was built in the year 1884 and has been known for its beauty ever since. The awe inspiring Gothic windows and woodcarvings bear testimony to the stunning architecture of the era passed. Complete with beautiful gardens, the palace now hosts a myriad of exhibitions and concerts. A complete tour of the palace would take only about an hour and a half, but you will remember the beauty and majesticity of the palace for the rest of your life. Entry Price: INR 230 for Indians and INR 460 for foreign tourists Opening Timings: 10: 00 to 17: 00 on all days</p>

        <p>The fort is especially important from a historical point of view because it is representative of the rich art forms and artistic talent that prevailed during those times. The two-storied structure has pillars, balconies and carved arches. The palace was originally constructed to be used by Tipu Sultan himself as a summer retreat. In fact, he had christened it 'Tashk-e-Jannat' which means the envy of heaven. It is quite interesting to note that while the palace represents Islamic style, one can also find a temple of Lord Ganesha there. This speaks volumes about the religious tolerance of Tipu Sultan, under whose aegis the construction was completed in 1791. History lovers should not miss the art gallery in the fort, which is home to hundreds of historical paintings and carvings. Entry Price: INR 15 for Indians/ INR 200 for foreign tourists Opening Timings: 8: 30 to 17: 30 on all days</p>

    <p>Originally built as a mud fort in 1537 by Kempe Gowda I, Bangalore Fort was finally transformed into a stone fort in 1761 by Haider Ali. Located in the heart of the city, the historical place in Bangalore is a sturdy fort that is currently in ruins. It was torn down by the British and what remains today is the historical Delhi Gate. Yet it is still a popular tourist attraction of the city.</p>

 <p>Vidhan Soudha is not only of extreme political importance to the city but is also one of the most prominent landmarks of Bangalore. This historical place in Bangalore cannot be undermined either. The building is a rich amalgamation of neo-Dravidian, British, Indio-Islamic and contemporary architecture. This speaks volumes about the degree of secularism in historical times. The foundation stone of this largest legislative building in India was laid by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru in the year 1951and the construction was completed under the supervision of the then Chief Engineer, late B.R.Manickam. While you are here, make sure to visit the Cubbon Park for a relaxed evening. Also, do not forget to stand back and admire the architecture of Bangalore's High Court.

    </figure>
    <p>This fort is held in high esteem by scholars and historians on account of the fact that the Tiger of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, was born here. Owing to its breathtaking architecture and historical association of great magnitude, tourists flock here in large numbers. Located 35 kilometres north of Bangalore, the fort has rich history attached to it. The fort was originally built by Mallabairegowda in 1501. Later, it was captured by Dalawai in 1747, and then again attacked by Marathas. Finally, it was taken over by Hyder Ali, and eventually, it passed onto his son Tipu Sultan. The entrances to the fort, though small, are richly decorated with plaster work. The Khas.</p>

    </figure>
<p>Lord Mayo, the then fourth Viceroy of India, was assassinated while on an official visit to the Andaman Islands in 1872. Naturally, his assassination had a profound effect all over the country. This led to the construction of multiple memorial institutions, Mayo hall being one of them. Complete with key stoned arches, impeccably executed consoles and intricate cornices, the building is a true beauty. Recently, an island fountain park was built in front of the building to add to the aesthetic appeal of the monument. The development of this historical place in Bangalore was undertaken by the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), a couple of departments of which the hall now houses.</p>
