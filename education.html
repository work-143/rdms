    <p>Until the early 19th century, education in Bangalore was mainly run by religious leaders and restricted to students of that religion.[1] The western system of education was introduced during the rule of Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. Subsequently, the British Wesleyan Mission established the first English school in 1832 known as Wesleyan Canarese School.[2] The Bangalore High School was started by the Mysore Government in 1858, and Bishop Cotton Boys' School was started in 1865. In 1945 when World War II came to an end, King George Royal Indian Military Colleges was started at Bangalore by King George VI, the school is popularly known as Bangalore Military School[3][4]
        In independent India, schools for young children (16 months to 5 years) are called nursery, kindergarten or Play school which are broadly based on Montessori or Multiple intelligence[5] methodology of education.[6] Primary and secondary education in Bangalore is offered by various schools and junior colleges which are affiliated to one of the boards of education, such as the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education, Central Board for Secondary Education, International Baccalaureate, International General Certificate of Secondary Education and National Institute of Open Schooling and Karnataka PUC Board. Schools in Bangalore are either government run or are private (both aided and un-aided by the government).[7][8] Bangalore has a significant number of International schools due to expats and IT crowd.[9] Students after completing their secondary education (SSLC, SSC) i.e Class 10th, will further pursue higher secondary education i.e Class 11th and Class 12th by either attending a Junior College or by continuing High School in one of three streams â€“ Science, Commerce or Arts. Alternatively, students may also enroll in Diploma courses. Upon completing the required coursework, students enroll in general or professional degrees in universities through regular or lateral entry.[10]</p>
