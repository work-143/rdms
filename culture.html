    <p>Karaga is one of the oldest and widely celebrated festivals of Karnataka. Karaga festival depicts the rich cultural and religious heritage of Karnataka. It is celebrated in honour of the Goddess Shakti. The festival is held at the famous Dharmarayaswamy temple in Bangalore
        The festival starts on the full moon day of Chaitra that falls in March/April. The festival derives its name from an earthen pot in which the Goddess Shakti is invoked. The celebrations last for 9 days, starting from the full moon day.Karaga is one of the oldest as well as most popular traditional festivals celebrated in Bangalore city. Karaga is celebrated on the full moon day of the first month of the Lunar Hindu calendar (Chaitra masa). Karaga is the festival of Tigalas who are Tamil speaking community. It is the worship of the Tigalas primary deity, Draupadi, whom they see as an incarnation of goddess Adi Shakti. The men of this community consider themselves as warriors (veerakumaras) of her army.  The Karaga, after which the festival gets its name, is a symbolic pyramidal floral structure, which is carried on the head of a person selected to be the Karaga carrier.
        Myth has it that the festival has its roots in the Mahabharata.  The Tigalas, who hold Draupadi as their principal deity, believe that Draupadi Shakti (power) brims over during the Karaga festival. The Karaga is an annual celebration of her as the “ideal woman” and of “woman-power”. It is believed that one of central characters of Mahabharata Draupadi took the incarnation of Adi Shakti meaning the source of energy in female form to kill a demon by name Tripurasura. She created a small army called Veerakumara for her aid. The army requested her not to return after the task was completed. But as this was the last leg of the Pandava’s journey to heaven, she could not stay back with the Veerakumars</p>

    <p>Though not alluding to the classical form of Ganapati, the earliest mention of Ganapati is found in the Rigveda. It appears twice in the Rigveda, once in shloka 2.23.1, as well as in shloka . Both of these shlokas imply a role of Ganapati as "the seer among the seers, abounding beyond measure in food presiding among the elders and being the lord of an invocation", while the shloka in mandala 10 states that without Ganapati "nothing nearby or afar is performed without you", according to Michael. However, it is uncertain that the Vedic term Ganapati which literally means "guardian of the multitudes", referred specifically to later era Ganesh, nor do the Vedic texts mention Ganesh Chaturthi. It appears in post-Vedic texts such as the Grhya Sutras and thereafter ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the Yajnavalkya Smriti and the Mahabharata mention Ganapati as Ganesvaras and Vinayak. Ganesh appears in the medieval Puranas in the form of "god of success, obstacle remover". The Skanda Purana, Narada Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, in particular, profusely praise him.  Beyond textual interpretations, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest Ganesha had become popular, was revered before the 8th century CE and numerous images of him are traceable to the 7th century or earlier
        For example, carvings at Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples such as at the Ellora Caves, dated between the 5th and 8th-century show Ganesha reverentially seated with major Hindu goddess (Shakti).</p>

                <p>Vijayadashami (Sanskrit: विजयदशमी, romanized: Vijayadaśamī), also known as Dussehra, Dasara or Dashain, is a major Hindu festival celebrated every year at the end of Navaratri.

                    Vijayadashami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian subcontinent.[1][9][6] In the southern, eastern, northeastern, and some northern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, remembering goddess Durga's victory against the buffalo demon Mahishasura to restore and protect dharma. In the northern, central and western states, it marks the end of Ramlila and commemorates god Rama's victory over the demon king Ravana. Alternatively, it marks a reverence for one of the aspects of goddess Devi, such as Durga or Saraswati
                    Vijayadashami celebrations include processions to a river or ocean front that involve carrying clay statues of Durga,[13] Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha and Kartikeya, accompanied by music and chants, after which the images are immersed in the water for dissolution and farewell. In other places, towering effigies of Ravana, symbolising evil, are burnt with fireworks, marking evil's destruction. The festival also starts the preparations for Diwali, the important festival of lights, which is celebrated twenty days after Vijayadasham</p>
